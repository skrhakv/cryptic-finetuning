# Hidden in protein sequences: Predicting cryptic binding sites
Binding sites that exhibit significant conformational changes are often referred to as cryptic binding sites (**CBS**). As correct prediction of these sites heavily depend on the particular protein conformation, structure-based methods often fail to correctly predict these sites. In this repository, we present various finetuning strategies for improving the model's performance.

## About
This work extends the CryptoBench dataset, which includes over 1,000 protein structures annotated with cryptic binding sites. We begin with simple transfer learning approach and incrementally add steps to the model to evaluate their impact compared to the baseline.
